-- Answer 1 
UPDATE applications
SET App_platform = 'Android'
WHERE App_platform=1;

UPDATE applications
SET App_platform = 'IOS'
WHERE App_platform=2;

SELECT applications.app_id, applications.app_name, Publishers.pub_name, applications.App_platform
FROM applications
JOIN Publishers ON applications.app_pub_id=Publishers.pub_id;

-- Answer 2 
SELECT Country, Impressions, Clicks

WHERE dateTime > now() - INTERVAL 7 day
ORDER BY dateTime DESC;


-- Answer 3 
SELECT Publishers.pub_name,Application_statistics.Impressions, Application_statistics.Clicks
FROM Application_statistics
JOIN applications
ON Application_statistics.App_id = applications.app_id
JOIN Publishers
ON applications.app_pub_id = Publishers.pub_id
